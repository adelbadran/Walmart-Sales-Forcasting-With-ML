# 🛒 Walmart Sales Forecasting with Machine Learning

## 📌 Description
Predicts Walmart’s weekly sales using historical data, store info, and external factors — leveraging Linear Regression as a baseline and XGBoost as an advanced model for more accurate demand forecasting.

---

## 📂 Dataset
This project uses the [Walmart Sales Forecast dataset by Aslan Ahmedov on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/walmart-sales-forecast).  

📄 Includes:
- 🗂️ Train data → Weekly sales data by store and department from Feb 2010 to Nov 2012.  
- 🗂️ Test data → Same format without Weekly_Sales values for prediction.  
- 🏬 stores.csv → Metadata for ~45 Walmart stores (**type** and **size**).  
- 📊 features.csv → External variables like Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, Unemployment, and Holiday_Flag.  

💡 This rich feature set enables modeling the effects of economic conditions and holidays on sales trends.

## 🧹 Preprocessing Steps
1. 🔗 Merge all datasets into one.
2. 🧼 Handle missing values & duplicates.
3. 🔢 Encode categorical features (`Type`, `IsHoliday`) into numeric format.
4. ⏳ Create time-based features (`Year`, Month, Week, Day, Season, etc.).
5. 📉 Generate lag & rolling mean features for capturing trends.
6. 📆 Perform seasonal decomposition to understand patterns.
7. ✂️ Remove outliers & apply scaling.

## 📊 Methodology
1. 📥 Data Loading & Merging → Combine Walmart sales, features, and store info.  
2. 🧽 Cleaning → Handle nulls, duplicates, and anomalies.  
3. 🏗️ Feature Engineering → Temporal, lag, and statistical features.  
4. 🎯 Model Training:
   - 📏 Linear Regression (**baseline model**)  
   - ⚡ XGBoost (**tuned with GridSearchCV**)  
5. 📈 Evaluation:
   - Metrics → SMAPE, RMSE, R²  
6. 👁️ Visualization → Compare actual vs predicted weekly sales.

## 📈 Results
| 🧠 Model             | 📉 SMAPE (%) | 📏 RMSE  | 📊 R²  |
|----------------------|-------------|---------|-------|
| 📏 Linear Regression | 35.43       | 18.33   | 0.98  |
| ⚡ XGBoost            | 28.31       | 13.16   | 0.99  |

✅ XGBoost significantly outperformed Linear Regression in accuracy and error reduction.  
📅 Seasonal trends & holiday effects were successfully captured.
